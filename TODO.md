- [ ] Automatically go into insert mode when entering a terminal window.
- [ ] Auto-refresh neo-tree when files are added/deleted/changed. (Neo-tree
  has a built-in setting for this, but can't remember it).
- [ ] Add plugin to render Markdown files.
- [ ] Make tab-completion work in Telescope (at least for file finder)
- [ ] Add smooth-scrolling plugin
- [ ] Make indent-blankline's vertical bars more subtle.  Defaults are too
  distracting.
- [ ] Change window border colors to be more visible.  Tokyonight's window
  borders are too dark to see against a dark background.
